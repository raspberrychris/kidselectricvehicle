### Customers Say about this product

> Love this go-kart. Bought for my sons 5th birthday and he hasn't stopped riding ever since we put it together and charged it. Drives it everyday until the battery is dead. Will go about 2-3 hours being driven continuously on a charge. Very sturdy. Will take several hours to fully assemble.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 Increases child's awareness of road safety and rules.|👉 Too Fast for Small Children: The highest speed setting on this toy car is too fast for small children. This could lead to accidents if the child is not careful.|
| 👉 Lock the speed to where max speed (3) can't be reached, so children will be safe. |👉 Does require a degree of parent supervision|
| 👉 The car goes pretty fast, so children will have a lot of fun with it.|👉 Not suitable for really young children: It is recommended for 3 years and older, so it may not be appropriate for younger children.|
