Hi there! I started Kids Electric Vehicle as I wanted people to make the best decision when it comes to buying kids electric cars, tractors and other kids vehicles.

Hi there, my name is Chris I am based in San Antonio, Texas. I am a parent and have a young son who is 6 years old. 

You might be wondering why did I start this site?  Well it all started a few years ago when my parents got my eldest son a kid's electric car one year as a birthday present.  

It was a lovely gift!

Since that time, I have bought a few more and buy the electric cars as gifts for friends and family with young children.  

Everytime I get a new electric vehicle I review it and give it a rating.  

I also do a degree of background research on the products to see what the view of this product is on popular sites such as Amazon.com.

It got to the point where I thought it would be a good place to share this information more widely online, so this is how this website started!

Hope you enjoy the website, if you have any tips on electric vehicles to review please let me know.

Thank you!

Chris
