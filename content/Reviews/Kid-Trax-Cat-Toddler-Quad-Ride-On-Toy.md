### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 The CAT Tough Toddler Quad is a great ride-on toy for kids who love construction vehicles.|👉 The battery only lasts for around an hour before it needs to be recharged, which can be frustrating for kids.|
| 👉 It has real foot pedal acceleration and a top speed of 1.5 MPH, making it both fun and safe for kids to play with.|👉 Some parents have complained that the quad is too slow and doesn't go very far on a full charge.|
| 👉 The included 6-volt battery and charger mean that the fun can go on for hours without having to stop for recharging breaks.|👉 Some children may find the design of the quad too "babyish" and outgrow it quickly compared to other ride-on toys on the market|
