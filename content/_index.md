Hi welcome to [Cat Tree Guide](https://cattreeguide.com), my name is Percy and I am the proud owner of a beautiful long fur Siberian Cat called Pacha.  I have used many Cat trees over the years and thought it would be a good idea to start a website that reviewed only the best cat trees.   

My reviews and guides are my honest opinion of these products.

### Customers Say about this product

> I purchased this hammock a year ago and it's still going strong. My cats have never cared about any other bed I've ever bought but theyve taken to this one immediately. There's a 100% chance that there is at least one cat in this hammock if they're not in the other room with me.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 Cat-Approved: Your kitty will love this scratcher, as it's covered in catnip or something similar.|👉 Chew proofing: It would be nice if this was made out of a material that cats couldn't easily chew through or scratch.|
| 👉 Easy Assembly: All parts are included and labeled, so you shouldn't have any trouble putting it together.|👉 Size: It's a little small and my cats have already outgrown it. I wish it was just a bit larger so they could enjoy it for longer.|
| 👉 Good Construction: This scratcher is well-made and should last for a long time.|👉 Sturdiness: Can tip over if Cat is playing with it vigorously.|

### Our Rating For This Product

It is a good cat tree and I recommend it to everyone.
In general, It is sturdy and lasts a long time, especially with a heavy cat. The color is good. The durability is not great but good enough. There are a few places my cat can get through it. Screws are not needed for assembly and it takes around 2 hours for the average person to put together. Assembly is easy, but does take some time.

### Customers Say about this product

> First off, this house is much smaller than it looks. Several of the pictures have photoshopped cats that are smaller in scale than the house. My kittens were 8 weeks old when I bought this and they fit fine.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 The house is small and kittens can easily fit in it.|👉  Kittens grow quickly and may outgrow this house|
| 👉  It has two upper perches which are stable and give the cats a place to play and relax.|👉  The house is smaller than it looks in pictures |
| 👉  The box that the perches mount on is not very stable, but it does not break easily and does not injure the cats.|👉  Stability in the upper perches could be better|

### Product Description 

The AIWIKIDE Cat Tree offers a comfortable and spacious home for your cat. It has three levels for your cat to climb up and down, providing them with an excellent place to scratch, sleep and play.

It also lets cats watch the view outside the window or just take in the view from high up.

### Our Rating For This Product

The instructions could be a little more clear, but it was pretty easy to put together. It's not the most stable thing in the world and can wobble a bit when my 1-year-old runs at it, but it's doing the trick so far. I'll probably try to secure it to the ground/wall once I get the tools.

> The tree itself looks nice and seems to be very sturdy. The top bed is very cushy. My son put it together for me and it took him about 1/2 hour. He said it was not bad at all.

| 👉 It's so soft! The quality of the cover semms really great, and the platform at the very top is basically a pillow.|👉  It doesn't have many features: This cat tree doesn't have many features compared to others on the market, which might make it less appealing to some customers.|

### Our Rating For This Product

I'm giving this tree five stars because each of my cats love it. It's a great size for my apartment, and best of all, it doesn't look tacky! My two more timid cats hide away in the house all the time, but they both went up and down the cat tree without fear. I think they figured out how fun it was to be on high furniture! I've had no problem with scratching the carpet either. The posts are solid and the design is attractive. It was easy enough to put together

### Customers Say about this product

> Fairly easy to put together once you can figure out how the bottom goes. There are three holes and they are only slightly different lengths apart. So getting the right posts in the right holes so the hideaway fits was tricky for me…could have been just me.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 Three cats can use it at the same time: This tree is big enough for three cats to use at the same time, which is great if you have multiple pets. |👉  Difficult to Assemble: One of the potential cons of this cat tree is that it may be difficult to assemble. There are three holes and they are only slightly different lengths apart, so getting the right posts in the right holes so the hideaway fits can be tricky|
| 👉  Hammock: The hammocks on this tree are a hit with my cats, and they love lounging in them.|👉  Not Suitable for All Cats: This cat tree is smaller, so it may not be suitable for all cats. Some larger cats may not be able to fit in the hide-a-way|
| 👉 Hide-a-way feature: My scaredy cat loves being able to hide away in this tree when she feels overwhelmed or nervous.|👉  May Not Be Durable: Another potential con is that this cat tree may not be as durable as other options on the market because it is smaller and made of lighter materials|

### Product Description 

This multi-level cat furniture will keep your indoor cat happy, healthy and entertained for hours. The BestPet 54in Cat Tree Tower for Indoor Cats provides a multitude of playful and comfortable places to rest or play. Each level offers multiple perches and a plushy condo where your kitty can curl up and sleep. There is also a sturdy sisal pole that they can scratch on if they desire. The BestPet Cat Tree is made from high-quality materials with skin-friendly faux fur all over.

### Our Rating For This Product

I really enjoy this cat tree tower. It's well made, and it's sturdy enough to handle my two playful cats. The fabric is really soft and high quality. I was worried the kittens would make a mess of it, but they haven't yet! The scratching post is thick and sisal in an excellent location, giving them an option to scratch when they want. I like the interaction the cat tree tower has with the rest of my living room décor. One thing I've noticed is that if you have long hair, watch out for getting it caught on the plushy material on the lounging/sleeping areas.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 It's well made and sturdy enough to handle two playful cats.|👉  Not all cats will use it: If you have more than one cat, there's no guarantee they'll both take to the cat tree tower.|
| 👉 The fabric is really soft and high quality. |👉  It can be unstable: The cat tree tower is top-heavy, so if your cats are climbing on it a lot or playing too roughly, it can tip over. This has happened to me twice already!
|
| 👉 The scratching post is thick and sisal in an excellent location, giving them an option to scratch when they want|👉  It sheds: Like all plushy fabrics, the fabric on the cat tree tower will shed over time as your cats scratch and play on it. This can leave your furniture and floors covered in fur if you're not careful |

### Our Rating For This Product

My cats are seriously in love with this cat tree. The hammock is too small for my two cats, but they regularly find their way onto the hammock. I ended up re-assembling it located on the central pole of the scratch pad, because otherwise the weight caused the structure to lean. It's much more sturdy in that configuration.

| 👉  It's sturdy: Even though I had to reassemble it, once I did it seems to be holding up well against the weight of the cats using it.|👉 Unattractive Design: This cat tree has an unattractive design that looks cheaply made|
| 👉  The hammock is a good size for them: It's not too big or too small for our cats, and they seem to really like using it as a place to lounge around and take naps.|👉 May be too small for some bigger cats|

### Product Description 

TSCOMON's cat tree is designed to be stable and safe. The cat tower has 3 resting areas where cats can play, rest or perch. The cat condo provides enough space for 1-2 kittens, the sleeping basket provides comfortable sleeping space and the hammock is a secure place for cats to rest their weary heads. This versatile cat tree meets all the life needs of your indoor cats.

### Our Rating For This Product

If you are looking for a tall Cat Tree that your cats can use to look out of a window, this one will fit the bill. In fact, it's so tall, we ended up taking the top tier off - it was too high up! The height also makes it seem a bit wobbly, but it does come with a strap, which is easy enough to secure to the wall. Aesthetically, the direction diagrams are alright, but could be more clear with regards to all the parts and where they're supposed to go. If your cat is a big baby and sits on his backside, he may not fit well on the flat part if you leave the top tier on.

### Customers Say about this product

> This was fairly easy to put together, took about 30 minutes. My cat almost immediately jumped right on it, he loves it! His favorite part is the very top perch! For being over 5 feet tall it is surprisingly very sturdy. He will jump from my bed (which is about 3 feet away) all the way to the top perch and it will wobble a bit but has never fallen over!

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |

### Our Rating For This Product

My cat loves this product. To give you some background I have a cat who follows me around like he'll implode if he's more than two feet away from my feet.  He sniffed around the base and then tried to climb and then he just settled in. I watched him for a while, and he was purring like crazy. He can't go a day without using his new tree.

### Customers Say about this product

> My cat loves to bake his old bones in direct sunlight. This is his favorite spot right in front of the window. I set it up and waited til the right time of day (morning sun) to show him his new sunny spot and he loved it immediately. My other cat loves the scratcher posts below it. Definitely a good buy for them.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉  The cat likes it!|👉 Not durable: The construction of the cat tree is a little on the light side, which means it may not be able to withstand a lot of wear and tear.|
| 👉 The kitty uses it daily and likes taking naps on it.|👉 May be unstable: Because the construction is not very sturdy, there is a risk that the cat tree could topple over if it is knocked into or if your cat jumps onto it with too much force. |
| 👉 It is a good height for the cat to sit on and look out of the window.|👉 Scratch posts are unnecessary: The included scratch posts are unnecessary because most cats will probably not use them.|

### Product Description 

FEANDREA Cat Tower is made of high-quality, eco-friendly and pet-safe materials. The cat tower is not only a cat tree, but also a scratching post and a perch. It has two top perches that are filled to the brim with soft padding to provide comfort for your cats. The scratching board is also a ramp and it can be used by cats as a ladder to climb up and down easily. The cat area has plenty of room for larger cats.

### Our Rating For This Product

My cat loves this tree. Up top, there's a little hammock and even a hole for hiding. The bottom is covered in a soft carpet for lounging on. There are ample dangling toys, including one that hangs right in the middle of the tree. The top of the tree has a plush pad with a tunnel leading to the bottom. All in all, this is a good quality tree that my cat seems to really enjoy - and at this price, it's worth it.

### Customers Say about this product

> This is a good-looking Cat Tower or, as I prefer, Cat Condo. But my two cats are too big for it. My brother and sister cats weigh 15lbs and 13lbs respectively.

### Our Rating For This Product

It is a very sturdy, good looking tower and I would highly recommend it. Assembly took 10 minutes and the instructions were easy to follow.

I have seen some "cheapo" towers in other people's homes that are poorly made and look tatty, so I was surprised at how well the instructions were. I built up quite a bit of trust with amazon basics brand over the years, either with pet things or cables, kitchen things. The one thing that is consistent is there are few bells and whistles, but what you get is reliably and robustly made. This tower takes up a lot of room, but it was worth the purchase.

### Product Description 

A cat tree for larger cats, this cat tower features a widened perch and is filled to the brim with edges to ensure your cats can stretch out comfortably. With a scratching board and a ladder in one, this two-in-one scratcher helps your cats scratch their itch or get up if they're elderly or have mobility issues. Made with 2 doors, this cat cave lets you easily let your cat in and out of the fluffy cave or go to the basket.

### Our Rating For This Product

This cat tower is the best purchase I've made for my cat. I wanted him to be able to easily get to a window sill we have and he could get to the second level, but then he couldn't get to the top because the oversized bed hung too far over. So, I took the top off and put that piece on the floor. He loves sleeping in it (on the floor) and can still get to the window sill when he wants to using the 2 levels left.

### Our Rating For This Product

The TINWEI cat tree is a great size for our smaller cat, and it has had a lot of enjoyment. Our cat has enjoyed climbing, lounging, and playing with the three accessories. We haven't had any issues with it thus far. It took about 30 minutes to assemble, but it is basically like building any other piece of boxed furniture.

### Customers Say about this product

> Relatively simple to assemble. The base was broken in the corner when it arrived unfortunately. It was right on the screw area so it broke even more when I was assembling. Luckily it seems ok for now and my cat is only 4 pounds so I'm hoping it will be fine. For the price, it's a nice cat tree.

My cat loved it. I love the tree, and it's tall so my cat can sit at the top or in nooks and crannies while I work.
I got a little worried when I was putting the ladder on.
Pros - Tall, easy to assemble, comes with its own wrench
Cons - Expensive for its size, screws were hard to put in
Suggestions - Better instructions for putting the ladder on would have been helpful.

### Product Description 

The Yaheetech cat tree is a perfect way to give your pets a space that is all their own.

The tower is made from carefully-selected materials, so it's both safe for your pets and for you.

### Our Rating For This Product

Assembly was easy, but I must warn you, there are a lot of pieces. I recommend using a socket wrench instead of an allen key, because assembly time is quite long with the allen key (think more than two hours). The price was a bit steep for me but I'm so happy I invested in a good product.

### Customers Say about this product

> Our 11 mo old kittens love every square inch of this. They even use the hammock.  One perches on the top and the other perches on the second tower. I do notice that the tower posts will wobble so I tend to turn them tighter for stability.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 The parts were standard quality and didn't have any issues.|👉 The risk of the plastic breaking if the bolts are tightened too hard.
 |
| 👉 Just gotta make sure not to tighten the bolts too hard so that the plastic doesn't break. |👉 The metal ring that attaches the strap to the wall ripped immediately.|
| 👉 The material feels nice and I'm sure my cats will enjoy it|👉 There is a possibility that the cats might not enjoy it as much as anticipated.|

### Product Description 

FEANDREA has a solution for your cat's boredom, stress, and loneliness. Your cat will love the soft plush, the many perches (including a hammock!), and the comfortable cushion in this large cat tower. With 3 removable pompoms and a spacious cave, there's plenty of room for cats to play and have fun.

### Our Rating For This Product

It is easy to set up and it is nice and tall for a tower. It also has a button strap so you can secure the tower to the wall for stability, which is great because my cats are very playful and I'm always worried they are going to knock it over. The material is soft and cool to the touch. There are two levels with different sections of size, and the second level has a little house for your cat to sleep in or play in. Support pieces are at the bottom which helps keep the base from wobbling.

### Customers Say about this product

> Three indoor kitties, one of whom is enthusiastically adamant about his personal bubble, took to this cat tree so beautifully.. it has room for all of them to occupy it simultaneously & apparently is very comfortable. They love the height and play or lay on it almost constantly

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 The platforms are padded and have a decent bumper on the sides. |👉 Cats ruin the tree: The girls love their new tree, but it doesn't last long because the cats quickly ruin it. |
| 👉 The condo got an adjustment, because one of our girls lives to look out the window.|👉 The platforms are too small: The platforms on the new tree are too small for the cats, and they will need to be replaced soon.|
| 👉 The platforms themselves are too small if I'm being honest, but the cats are a bit smaller than other kitties so ut will work for awhile |👉 The condo got an adjustment: One of our cats lives to look out the window, so we had to adjust the condo accordingly.|

### Our Rating For This Product

I was impressed by the Yaheetech Cat Tree Tower Kitten Condo Scratching Post with Hammock Tunnel. I definitely noticed a difference in my kitten's activity level and energy levels just from putting this in their living space. I was worried about the stability because it is a tall tower, but then I found out that there is an anchor strap to secure it to the wall so that it won't topple over.

### Customers Say about this product

> The only complaint I have about this is that one of the rings on the ladder part came off within a week of getting it, leaving exposed staples that the kitties could get scratched on. Easy enough fix to glue it back on, but I wish it was more durable.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 The cat condo is made of sturdy materials and is able to withstand rough play. |👉 The circle makes the cat get stuck: One of the potential cons of this product is that the circle in it can cause the cat to get stuck. This can happen if the cat is not careful or if it is not very agile.|
| 👉 The cat condo has multiple levels and features, providing your cat with plenty of space to explore and play.|👉 The hammock only fits a kitten: Another potential con of this product is that the hammock included with it only fits a kitten, so it would not be suitable for larger cats. |
| 👉 The cat condo is carpeted, providing a soft surface for your cat to lounge on. |👉 The carpet may not hold up over time: Another potential issue with this product is that the carpeting on it may not hold up over time, potentially creating an issue for those who have pets who like to scratch or claw at things.|

### Our Rating For This Product

If you have a large house and want to give your cats a space to climb, this is the perfect cat tree for them. We had a 67" cat tree and two cats. The youngest loved it, but our eldest never used it. Then my husband found out he has diabetes and his back legs were starting to give out. Our old cat tree just wasn't suitable anymore. We wanted to upgrade to something that would help with his climbing and the boys love this cat tree! There are different heights so the youngest can use all the tallest towers, and the eldest loves everything else. We've even seen him climb to the upper house, with only one thing - it's been hard to find him because he's not as vocal anymore.

### Product Description 

The PETEPELA Cat Tower is a great way to provide your cat with climbing and lounging areas. The entire cat tree consists of 5 levels of platforms, each with a height difference of 17.3 inches per level. The tension rod on the top can be adjusted to a preferred height from high to low (95-109 Inches) and the posts are thicker than other posts on the market, making this tree both sturdy and durable.

### Our Rating For This Product

The pet tree is a good selection for indoor cats that need exercise. I like the height adjustment so it doesn't hog too much bedroom space and goes to about an inch from the ceiling. I had some issues with assembly. The product page says the height is adjustable between 89.8-107.9 inches, but when assembled the tower was less than an inch from the ceiling. The compression topper is also just under an inch on its own, so there wasn't much room to install the extension tubes. All in all, though, it's a good deal and worth the price if you're looking for a cat tower.

### Our Rating For This Product

This is a pretty tall cat tree and my cats love it. It can be wobbly and I wouldn't recommend it for a small apartment or if the cats are aggressive, but otherwise the cats really seem to like it. My two boys have been using it for a month now and it's still intact.

### Customers Say about this product

> Our cats love it! Our older cat just sleeps in on but our younger one loves to hang up side down and “thump” the toys with his back feel! Best thing I have spent money on in a long time.

### Pros and Cons

| ✅ Pros | ❌ Cons |

| 👉 The construction is good and it comes with extra parts.|👉 Not always stable: The base is too small for such a tall cat tree, which makes it less stable overall.|
| 👉 It's easy to put together because the parts are labeled and the directions are clear.|👉 Too low hammock: The kitties will not lay on the hammock because it is too low for them to be comfortable.|
| 👉 The cat tree is tall, which is great for full-grown cats.|👉 Wall strap not long enough: The wall strap is not long enough to provide adequate support for the cat tree, making it more likely to tip over.|

### Our Rating For This Product

I would say I had an overall positive experience with the tree. It took me about an hour to assemble and it was pretty easy. I like how stable it is and as expected, my cat loves it. The only thing that I didn't enjoy about the tree was that the posts weren't quite heavy enough so the whole thing is a bit wobbly when my cat is on top. Once my cat gets used to this, it won't be a problem. Overall, I'm happy with the product.

My little kittens love this thing and I love them so it's a win-win. The instructions are not perfect, but they're not horrible.

They are both in the basket right now. The price point is excellent and this is a great purchase.

I bought this because my cats were using the tops of their cat tree as scratching posts and I liked the idea of them having their own scratch post.

Highly recommend this kit for the price point!

Vesper Cat Furniture is perfect if you're on the lookout for a cat tower that will look nice with your home's decor and isn't ugly. It's easy to clean, and the soft parts are detachable and can be cleaned or replaced. The only downside is it's a bit more expensive than other towers, but I think it's worth investing in because it is durable and will last a long time unlike trees made of carpet.
