### Customers Say about this product

> The ability to control it with a remote?! Genius!!! My 3 year old got the green tractor he asked for (which amazed him) and we can ride him around so he can use it before he’s old enough to really understand controlling the wheel and pedal. BRILLIANT. Also not huge. Love this item.

### Customers Say about this product

> Bought this bike for our sons 3rd birthday. He’s about 3ft tall, and 35lbs and can ride this bike so easily! Battery will need to be plugged in for at least 18 hours prior to the first ride so order in advance if you’re buying for a present. It took about 30 mins to assemble it too. Overall it’s a great 12v bike and you can’t beat the price!
