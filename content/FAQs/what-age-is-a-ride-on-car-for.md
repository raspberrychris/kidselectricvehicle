The age limit for riding a ride-on car is 5-8 years. Although, the manufacturer's recommendations may differ somewhat. 

But it’s safe to say that as long as your child can safely climb in and out of the vehicle, and has sufficient mobility to reach the controls, he or she is ready to drive. 

Before purchasing a ride on car, it’s important to ensure that the product meets specific safety standards. 

Most companies that manufacture ride on cars will provide this information in their product descriptions.
