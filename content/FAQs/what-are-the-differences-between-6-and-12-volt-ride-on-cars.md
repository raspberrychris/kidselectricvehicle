Well, there are some main differences between a 6 volt ride on car and a 12 volt. 

The main differences are weight or age range, the surfaces they can drive over, run times and speed. 

12 Volt ride on cars will perform better on flat surfaces such as tarmac although they will still operate on most surfaces such as grass and gravel, 6 Volt ride on cars are only for use on flat hard tarmac surfaces. 

12 volt cars will generally take more weight so will operate at a higher age range. 3-5 years for 6 volt and 3-7 or 8 years for 12 volt. 

Age ranges are only estimated as children vary in shape and size. 

On average 6 volt cars will operate for 30-60 minutes, 12 volt cars will on average operate for 1 hour 20 minutes -2 hours dependent on battery quality. 

Another difference is that while the motor may be the same size the way they are set up dictates the speed of both styles of scooters so again the 12 volters get to go faster than the 6 voltage versions
