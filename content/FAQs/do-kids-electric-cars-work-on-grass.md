This Depends on the car. 

All the cars we sell are designed to work on both grass and flat hard surfaces such as tarmac so should have no problems there. The only thing is that the 12 volt cars are better suited for weight bearing more than 6 volt ones and also will tend to last longer. 

So if you have a heavy kid that weighs more than average for his age then I would recommend a 12 volt car, if not then a 6 volt one will do fine.
