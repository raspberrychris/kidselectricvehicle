# What Age Are Electric Toy Cars For

The recommended age for an electric car is 12 months and up. This is because they are lightweight, run on batteries, have no sharp parts or small pieces that are easily lost, and are safe for babies to play with.

12v battery vehicles are suitable for ages 3-5 years. 

24v battery vehicles are suitable for ages 5+ years. 

48v battery vehicles are suitable for ages 6+ and over.
