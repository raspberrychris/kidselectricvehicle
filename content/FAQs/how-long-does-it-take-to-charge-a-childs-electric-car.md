In general, electric cars are quick and easy to charge. It's a matter of plugging them into a wall outlet. 

The charging time will depend on the capacity of the battery, which is indicated by kWh. 

This can range from 2 to 16 kWh. The higher the capacity, the longer it will take to charge the battery. 

On average, it takes between 6 and 8 hours to reach full capacity with a medium-voltage 12-volt battery with a 2â€“16 kWh battery.
