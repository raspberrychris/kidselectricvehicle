The Power Wheels are not completely waterproof. 

Being electric vehicles, these cars rely on a battery to provide power, and if this short circuit or get wet, it can seriously damage the car. 

Therefore, it’s important to ensure that you don’t store the vehicle outside in wet weather, and that you don’t let your kids ride on the vehicle if it has been recently been exposed to rain.
